There are plenty of good desktop budgeting applications, which require manual
entry of data from your accounts. They are flexible and powerful, but they
require sitting down for a long time each month to enter data and draw up the
reports and budgets. If you put it off, the amount of data only grows, making
the task even more arduous. It's a vicious cycle.

Some desktop budgeting applications allow you to download data, which can be
finicky, but if it works, it's great. This reduces the tedium by a lot. However,
these tools still require you to sit down at your laptop and categorize data.

There are budgeting web apps like Mint, but in my opinion they stink --
especially Mint. It's ad laden, inflexible, and honestly quite slow to use.
However, web applications provide the convenience of budgeting on your phone or
computer, which is freeing.

Shiso attempts to build a better version of a web-based budgeting system. It's
written by me, for me, with the following goals:

1. Transactions can be fetched automatically, so that you just need to
   categorize them.
2. Runs on phone or desktop equally, so there's tons of flexibility on when you
   can use it. You could categorize the restaurant bill on the ride home!
3. Splitting with a significant other is part of the core of the app, to make it
   simple to settle up at the end of the month.
4. *Every transaction must be reviewed.* Reviewing is a quick process involving
   assigning a category, maybe making a note, and determining how splitting
   should work. It can be completed in 10 seconds for most transactions. By
   requiring each transaction to be reviewed, it's easy to detect fraud or
   incorrect transactions. Plus, since review is quick and easy, you can do it
   frequently. That way you'll remember what that credit card transaction is,
   because you just made it a few days ago.
