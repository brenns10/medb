MeDB is a personal, self-hosted web application. I run it within my home
network, and can always access it via Wireguard. There are two guiding ideas
about MeDB:

1. First is to make a general framework that makes it easy to write small,
   simple apps (modules) for personal use. By putting everything into one
   monolithic application, I can quickly add new modules with no new maintenance
   burden. I can make things that add convenience to my life.

2. The other guiding principle is to be able to own my own data. In today's
   world, hosted cloud services have databases full of information about me.
   I think it's unfair that they have direct SQL and programmatic access to my
   data, yet I -- the owner of that information -- do not. MeDB's second goal is
   to use APIs to maintain my own copy of whatever data I can.

MeDB is organized into modules. There are only a few right now.

## Shiso

Shiso is an herb which is, in my opinion, better than mint.

Shiso is also the name of my module which, is definitely better than Mint!
